Gender Recognition From Bangla Handwritten Dataset

Handwriting-based gender classiÔ¨Åcation is a well-researched problem that has been approached mainly by traditional machine learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a basic artificial neural network which is implemented by the Multilayer Perceptron approach.We have used a considerably small dataset which is a part of a relatively bigger dataset to reach some encourageable results.We have conducted two experiments to understand the contrast between the convergence of the two experiments.
